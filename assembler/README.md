# crew-assembler !

experiments with a CLI-based, TOML-loading [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI/) runner.

run your poetry install on *this* `pyproject.toml`, then use `assembler -c <config_name>` to run a crew! make sure to use `poetry install --extras "web"` to use the yt_transcript example. ðŸ«¡
